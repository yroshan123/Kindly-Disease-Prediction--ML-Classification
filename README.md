## Project Overview
**Kindly** is a machine learning–based system designed to predict kidney disease using multiple classification algorithms. The project demonstrates how classical ML approaches can aid early risk detection and improve clinical decision support through pattern recognition in patient health data.

The repository includes implementations of several ML models and allows users to run and compare them easily.

---

## Features
- Multiple ML classification algorithms:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC)**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network**
- Clean and modular structure for experimenting with different models.
- Ready-to-use dataset for training and evaluation.
- Easily extensible for additional models, hyperparameter tuning, or deployment.
